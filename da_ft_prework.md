## **Excel**

### Exercise 1:

Excel can be used to load in data from a lot of different sources and makes doing so very easy and intuitive. After launching Excel, we are greeted by the `Home` screen. In this screen, we will see three different panes off to the left hand side. `Home`, `New`, and `Open`. 

Once we select the open button, we will want to click on `Browse` and select the file we want to open in Excel.
