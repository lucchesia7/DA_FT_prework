        <h2>Excel</h2>
    <hr>
        <h3>Walk-Through</h3>
        <p>
            Excel can be used to load in data from a lot of different sources and makes doing so very easy and intuitive. 
            Excel is also a great predictor. It is useful for intaking data 
            After launching Excel, we are greeted by the <code>Home</code> screen. In this screen, we will see three different panes off to the left 
            hand side. <code>Home</code>, <code>New</code>, and <code>Open</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we select the open button, we will want to click on <code>Browse</code> option 
            and select the file we want to open in Excel.
        </p>
        <p>
            With csv files, Excel will infer the format it imports in. You can verify that the data has been 
            loaded correctly by seeing the column names in the top row followed by data in each other row. 
            Each row should have a value and each column should be a variable.
        </p>

        <h3>Creating Visualizations</h3>
        <p>
            Excel is great at creating visualizations with little to no effort. To do so, we can select the rows or columns which we want 
            create a visualization from. Then, using the Insert tab, we can select a visualization which we want to insert into the data.
        </p>
	    <h3>Exercises</h3>
	    <ul>
		    <li>Complete the following exercises in an <code>.xlsx</code> file.</li>
		    <li>Upload the file to github.com and submit the link to the Git Repository to the Google Classroom Assignment.</li>
            <h4><strong>Exercise 1:</strong></h4>
            <p>Using Excel, load in the dataset located <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/takahirokubo0/annual-financial-data-for-hybrid-cdp-kpi">here</a>.</p>
            <h4><strong>Exercise 2:</strong></h4>
            <p>Create a bar chart of the <code>Fiscal Year</code> and <code>Revenue</code> columns.</p>
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h2>MySQL</h2>
    <hr>
        <h3>Walk-Through</h3>
        <h4>Create a Database</h4>
        <p>
            After installation of MySQL, we can open the Workbench, our GUI (Graphic User Interface) for MySQL operations. 
            When opened, we are greeted by the MySQL welcome screen. Don't worry too much about the GUI yet, we will be covering over it in class.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the screen in bold letters is MySQL Connections. Next to this, is a small <code>+</code> button. 
            This is how we will set up our new connection. Once we click on this, we will focus on the <code>Stored Connection</code> 
            and the <code>Test Connection</code> variables. Click on <code>Connection Name</code> and name your connection <code>test</code>. After that, click on the 
            <code>Test Connection</code> button to verify that you have a connection to your database you are trying to create. In the event that the connection fails, 
            you may want to double check your firewall or antivirus. You may also need to open the port on your computer to accept connections!
        </p>
        <p>
            Once we test the connection and have verified that it works, click the <code>OK</code> button to create your first database. 
            Then we can click on the connection name and open our database.
        </p>
        <h4><strong>Create a Table</strong></h4>
        <p>Structured Query Language(SQL) is how we interact with a MySQL database.</p>
        <p>
            To create a table, we specify using SQL keywords <code>CREATE</code> and <code>TABLE</code>, 
            giving a table name and the names of columns we wish to add to the table.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS >table_name<(
                id INT,
                product VARCHAR(50),
                quantity INT,
        
            )
        </pre>
        <p>You can read more about creating a table in SQL <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_create_table.asp">here</a></p>
        <h4>Inserting Data</h4>
        <p>Now that we have created a table, we will need to add data to it. This is done in SQL using the <code>INSERT</code> keyword.</p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            INSERT INTO >table_name<
            VALUES(
                value1,
                value2,
                value3
            )
        </pre>
        <p>For more on how to utilize the <code>INSERT</code> statement in MySQL, check out <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/mysql_insert.asp">this</a> resource.</p>
        <h4>Querying Data</h4>
        <p>Now that we have a table and data inside that table, 
            what if I wanted to view my data? This is where queries come in! Queries are how we access and return data from a table. A query utilizes the SQL keyword <code>SELECT</code>
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            SELECT * FROM >table_name<
        </pre>
        <p>
            <code>*</code> in SQL has a special meaning. It will return all the data within a table!
            So, when we run our statement above, we will be returning all data available within our table.
        </p>
        <h3>Exercises</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Complete the following exercises in MySQL</li>
            <li>Save your code for all exercises to a single .sql file and upload the file to your GitHub Repository</li>
            <h4>Exercise 1:</h4>
                <p>
                    Create a table named <code>customers</code>. Your table should have three columns in it's creation.
                    <ul>
                        <li>cust_id</li>
                        <li>cust_name</li>
                        <li>address</li>
                    </ul>
                </p>
            <h4>Exercise 2:</h4>
                <p>Now that you have created a <code>customers</code> table, insert in three rows of data
                    You are free to choose the data that you insert into your table.
                </p>
            <h4>Exercise 3:</h4>
                <p>Query all the data from your database.</p>
            
        </ul>
    <br>
        <h2>R</h2>
    <hr>
        <h3>Walk-Through</h3>
        <p>
            After installing R and R Studio, we will launch R Studio. R Studio has a lot in it's GUI, all of 
            which we will be covering over together during our course. Today, we will focus on the <code>new file</code>
            button, located in the top left corner of R Studio. We will create a new <code>.R, or R Script</code> file.
            Now that we have our new file, we can begin to work with R!
        </p>
        <h4>Variable Assignment</h4>
        <p>
            Once you have your new file open in front of you, we will begin with variable assignment. In R, variable assignment
            uses the <code><-</code> operand to assign a variable name to a value.
        </p>
        <p><strong>
            For Example:</strong>Let's say I wanted to create a variable named <code>x</code> and save the value <code>3</code> to it.
            The code would look like:
        </p>
        <pre>
            x <- 3
        </pre>
        <h4>Working with Numerical Values</h4>
        <p>
            R allows users to perform a variety of operands with integer values. Some examples of these operands would be: <code>+</code>,
            <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>%%</code>, <code>%/%</code>. Let's take a look at how we can apply these to some numerical values:
        </p>
        <pre>
            # Create two numerical variables
            num_1 <- 3
            num_2 <- 5
            
            # Perform addition
            num_1 + num_2
            
            # Perform subtraction
            num_1 - num_2
            
            # Perform multiplication
            num_1 * num_2
            
            # Perform division
            num_1 / num_2
            
            # Perform floor division, returning the product of the division without a remainder
            num_2 %/% num_1

            # Perform modulus, returning the remainder of the division
            num_2 %% num_1
        </pre>
        <h4>Character Manipulation</h4>
        <p>
            What if I wanted to create two character strings and save them to the variables
            <code>my_first_name</code> and <code>my_last_name</code>? The code for that would look like:
        </p>
        <pre>
            my_first_name <- "Alex"
            my_last_name <- "Lucchesi"
        </pre>
        <p>
            Now, we have our two variables containing our name. How can I change this into a single variable
            named <code>my_full_name</code> instead? In R, we can utilize the <code>paste</code> function. 
            <code>paste</code> concatenates values given, spearating them by a <code>sep</code> argument.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            my_full_name <- paste(my_first_name, my_last_name, sep=' ')
        </pre>
        <p>
            We can also use the print() function to concatenate pieces of our print statement with variables
            we have created.
        </p>

        <pre>
            # Print a character string that has "My name is:" and our full name
            print("My name is:", my_full_name)
        </pre>
        <h4>Vectors</h4>
        <p>
            In R, we will work a lot with vectors. A vector is like a list in Python, but can only hold a single
            data type. Vectors are highly functional and an important part of Data Analysis
        </p>
        <p>
            To create a vector, we use the <code>c()</code> function in R, passing in the values we wish to add to the vector,
            separated by a comma.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            # Create a numerical vector and save it to the variable my_vec
            my_vec <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9)
        </pre>
<br>
        <p>
            Numerical vectors support element-wise operations; meaning we can add, 
            subtract, multiply, and divide vectors across each value in each vector.
        </p>
        <p><strong>For Example:</strong></p>
        <pre>
            # Create a new numerical vector and save it to the variable my_vec2
            my_vec2 <- c(9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1)
            
            # Create a new variable named my_added_vec which adds both vectors together
            my_added_vec <- my_vec + my_vec2
            
            # View the new vector
            print(my_added_vec)
        </pre>

        </ul>
        <h4>Exercise 1:</h4>
        <p>
            Create three variables; x, y, and z. Assign each of these variables a numerical value,
            then perform each of the operands you have learned about so far to all three variables.

        <h3>Task 2: Follow These Coding Exercises</h3>
        <p>
            Please try the following code examples yourself by opening up the Command Prompt(if using Windows) or Terminal (if using Linux/Mac),
            type in <code>Python</code> and press Enter. You should see <code>>>></code>. If you don't, then make sure you have Python installed
            and the PATH is added to your environment variables.
        </p>
        <h4>Using Python as a Calculator</h4>
        <p>
            The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression in it and it will return the value.Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators <code>+</code>,
            <code>-</code>,<code>*</code>, and <code>/</code> work just like in most other languages (for example, R or C); parentheses (<code>()</code>)can be used for grouping.
            <strong>For Example:</strong>
        </p>
        <pre>
            >>> 2+2
            4
            
            >>> 50 - 5*6
            20
            
            >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4
            2.0
            
            >>> 8/5 # Division always returns a floating point number(decimal)
            1.6
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>
            Integer numbers, (i.e. 2,4,20) have an <code>int</code> type, the ones with a fractional part (i.e. 5.0, 1.6)
            are considered a <code>float</code> type. Division (<code>/</code>) will always return a float type. To do floor division,
            and get an integer result (discarding the remainder of the division), we can perform floor division. This is done in Python by using
            the <code>//</code> operand. If you wanted to return only the remainder of the division, we would use the modulus operand (<code>%</code>)
        </p>
        <pre>
            >>> 17 / 3 # Normal division, returns a float type
            5.66666666667

            >>> 17//3 # Floor division discards the remainder, returns int type
            5
            >>> 17 % 3 # Modulus operand, returns remainder of division, returns int type
            2
            >>> 5 * 3 + 2 
            <br>
            # With Python, it is possible to use the ** operand to calculate exponents
            >>>
            >>> 5 ** 2 # 5 squared
            25
            >>> 2 ** 7 # 2 to the power of 7
            128
        </pre>
        <br>
        <p>
            The equal sign (<code>=</code>) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the next interactive
            prompt. There is full support for floating point; operators with mixed type operands convert the integer operand to floating point:
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            >>> width = 20
            >>> height = 5 * 9
            >>> width * height
            900

            >>> 4 * 3.75 - 1
            14.0

        <h4>Strings in Python</h4>
        <p>
            Besides numbers, Python can also be used to manipulate strings, which can be expressed in several ways. 
            They can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...") with the same result. \ can be used to escape quotes:
        </p>
        <br>
        <pre>
            >>> 'spam eggs' # Single quotes

            >>> 'doesn\'t' # uses \ to escape the single quote
            "doesn't"

            >>> "doesn't" # Using double quotes, we can add in a quotation mark without having to escape
            "doesn't"

            >>> '"Yes," he said.'
            '"Yes," he said.'
        </pre>

        <p>
            If you want to concatenate variables or a variable and a literal, use +:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> prefix = 'Py'
            >>> prefix + 'thon123'
            'Python123'
        </pre>

        <p>
            Strings can be indexed (subscripted), with the first character having index 0. 
            There is no separate character type; a character is simply a string of size one:
        </p>
        
        <pre>
            >>> word = 'Python'
            >>> word[0]  # character in position 0
            'P'
            
            >>> word[5]  # character in position 5
            'n'
        </pre>

        <p>
            Indices may also be negative numbers, to start counting from the right:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> word[-1]  # last character
            'n'

            >>> word[-2]  # second-last character
            'o'

            >>> word[-6]
            'P'
        </pre>

        <p>
            In addition to indexing, slicing is also supported. While indexing is used to obtain individual characters, slicing allows you to obtain substring:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> word[0:2]  # characters from position 0 (included) to 2 (excluded)
            'Py'
            
            >>> word[2:5]  # characters from position 2 (included) to 5 (excluded)
            'tho'
        </pre>

        <p>
            Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> word[:2] + word[2:]
            'Python'

            >>> word[:4] + word[4:]
            'Python'
        </pre>

        <p>
            Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> word[:2]   # character from the beginning to position 2 (excluded)
            'Py'
            
            >>> word[4:]   # characters from position 4 (included) to the end
            'on'
            
            >>> word[-2:]  # characters from the second-last (included) to the end
            'on'
        </pre>

        <h4>Python Lists</h4>

        <p>
            Python knows a number of compound data types, used to group together other values. The most versatile is the list, which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between square brackets. 
            Lists might contain items of different types, but usually the items all have the same type.
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> squares = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
            
            >>> squares
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Like strings (and all other built-in sequence type), lists can be indexed and sliced:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> squares[0]  # indexing returns the item
            1
            
            >>> squares[-1]
            25
            
            >>> squares[-3:]  # slicing returns a new list
            [9, 16, 25]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Lists also support operations like concatenation:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> squares + [36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
            [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
        </pre>

        <p>
            Unlike strings, which are immutable, lists are a mutable type, i.e. it is possible to change their content:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> cubes = [1, 8, 27, 65, 125]  # something's wrong here
            >>> 4 ** 3  # the cube of 4 is 64, not 65!
            64
            
            >>> cubes[3] = 64  # replace the wrong value
            >>> cubes
            [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
        </pre>

        <p>
            You can also add new items at the end of the list, by using the append() method (we will see more about methods later):
        </p>
        <pre>
            >>> cubes.append(216)  # add the cube of 6
            
            >>> cubes.append(7 ** 3)  # and the cube of 7
            >>> cubes
            [1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343]
        </pre>
        <p>
            Assignment to slices is also possible, and this can even change the size of the list or clear it entirely:
        </p>

        <pre>
            >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
            >>> letters
            ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g']
            
            >>> # replace some values
            >>> letters[2:5] = ['C', 'D', 'E']
            >>> letters
            ['a', 'b', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'f', 'g']
            
            >>> # now remove them
            >>> letters[2:5] = []
            >>> letters
            ['a', 'b', 'f', 'g']
            
            >>> # clear the list by replacing all the elements with an empty list
            >>> letters[:] = []
            >>> letters
            []
        </pre>

        <p>
            The built-in function len() also applies to lists:
        </p>
        <pre>
            >>> letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
            >>> len(letters)
            4
        </pre>

        <h3>Task 2: Follow these Coding Exercises</h3>
        <p>Please try the following coding examples yourself</p>

        <h3>Python Control Flow</h3>
        <h4>Indentation</h4>
        <p>Python Uses Indentation to do Control Flow.
            It is important to keep a good understanding of how indentation works in Python to maintain the structure and order of your code.
        </p>
        <h4>The Three Ways</h4>
        <p>In this universe, anything can be done by these three ways:</p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Step by Step: Line by Line</li>
            <li>Branch: If... elif...else</li>
            <li>Looping: For, While</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Branch: if... elif... else...</h4>
        <p>
            The if Statement in Python allows us to tell the computer to perform alternative actions based on a certain set of results.

            Verbally, we can imagine we are telling the computer: "Hey if this case happens, perform some action"

            We can then expand the idea further with elif and else statements, which allow us to tell the computer:
            "Hey if this case happens, perform some action. Else if another case happens, perform some other action. Else-- none of the above cases happened, perform this action"

            Let's go ahead and look at the syntax format for if statements to get a better idea of this:
        </p>
        <pre>
            if case1:
                perform action1
            elif case2:
                perform action2
            else:
                perform action 3
        </pre>
        <p>Let's see a quick example of this:</p>
        <pre>
            >>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))
            Please enter an integer: 42
            >>> if x < 0:
                    x = 0
                    print('Negative changed to zero')
                elif x == 0:
                    print('Zero')
                elif x == 1:
                    print('Single')
                 else:
                    print('More')
                ...
                More
        </pre>
        <h4>Looping: for, while</h4>
        <p>
            The for statement in Python is used to do repeating.
            Python's for statement iterates over the items of any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence.
        </p>
        <pre>
            >>> # Measure some strings:
            ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']
            >>> for w in words:
            ...     print(w, len(w))
            ...
            cat 3
            window 6
            defenestrate 12
        </pre>
        <h3>Functions in Python</h3>
        <p>Functions will be one of our main building blocks when we construct larger and larger amounts of code to solve problems.</p>
        
        <h4>What is a function?</h4>
        <p>
            Formally, a function is a useful device that groups together a set of statements so they can be run more than once. They can also let us specify parameters that can serve as inputs to the functions. On a more fundamental level, 
            functions allow us to not have to repeatedly write the same code again and again.

            There are two kinds of functions: built-in functions, which are already created by python, and User defined functions (UDF)

            For example, the function len(), which is a built-in function, is used to get the length of a string or a list. Since checking the length of a sequence is a common task you would want to write a function that can do this repeatedly at command. 
            Function is one of most basic levels of reusing code in Python.
        </p>
        <h4>Function Syntax</h4>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Indentation and the def Statement are used to build out a function in Python.</li>
            <li>A list of parameters in (x, y, z). It is possible for a function to not have any parameters just like (). Do not forget the ':', at the end of the first line of the function definition.</li>
            <li>Use a return statement, a function will return a result that can then be stored as a variable, or used in whatever manner a user wants.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Here is a basic example:</p>
        <pre>
            >>> def add_num(num1,num2):
            ...     return num1+num2
            
            >>> add_num(4,5)
            9
        </pre>
        <p>Here is a UDF(User Defined Function), it tests if a given number is prime</p>
        <pre>
            >>> def is_prime(num):
                '''
                Naive method of checking for primes.
                '''
                for n in range(2,num):
                    if num % n == 0:
                        print ('not prime')
                        break
                else: # If never mod zero, then prime
                    print ('prime')
            >>> is_prime(25)
            not prime
        </pre>
